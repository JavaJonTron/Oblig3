I created a repository on github and uploaded the project folder to the repository. 
I then cloned the repostory locally to my computer.
In the actions tab on my repository i choose to configure Python application.
I then committed the .yml file that appeared.
Finally i test comitted changes to see if i could use the workflow correctly
